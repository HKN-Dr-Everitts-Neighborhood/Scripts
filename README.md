Scripts
=======

A bunch of small scripts for random things

* format_corporate_data.py: takes the csv of the data from the corporate survey, and generates a file per response of wiki markup, which is meant to be pasted directly onto the wiki.  Note, this depends on the python package unidecode (so to use it, you'll have to install unidecode via pip first).
